## Project in Westlake University
1: Few-shot Domain Adaptation for IMU Denoising: With a paper in arxiv. Using Meta-learning and reference the DCNN structure when dealing with the sequence data.




2: Visual language navigation (in processing): A task with visual information and language information. Try to deal with the bias in the task to improve the success rate for the agent. 





## Project in Columbia University:

# Machince Learning:

Spam Classification(Maximum Likelihood Estimation)
MNIST Classification(Decision Tree)
Kaggle competition about predicting the year of the song(Rank top 22% with LightGBM) https://www.kaggle.com/c/4771-sp21-regression/leaderboard
K-means in transformed space

# Evolutionary Algorithm

```markdown
Using simple rules and physical simulation, we evolve a robot which can run with the gait like the fastest land animal cheetah.

# Reinforcement Learning

Implement reinforcement learning on a quadruped robot 

The dog is controlled by a hierarchical control architecture. The upper part is a reinforcement learning structure (SAC) which outputs the abstract command. The under part is a optimal control sturcture which implements the abstract command to the commands for the motors.
